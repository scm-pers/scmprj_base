I always hear the following from other ClearCase users. "Deliver from development stream to integration stream" "Rebase from integration stream to development stream"

I know what they mean but I feel that they do not sound 100% correct. What are the correct/acceptable ways of saying rebase/deliver in ClearCase? 


In short,
•
 When we deliver, we deliver a baseline TO another stream 
 
•
 When we rebase, we rebase a stream TO a baseline of another stream
 

Please note that we speak from the view point of the development stream.
•
 For development stream to send changes to integration stream, we deliver the development stream 's baseline to integration stream 
 
•
 For development stream to receive changes from integration stream, we rebase the development stream to a baseline of integration stream
 

When we deliver, we have the options to
•
 deliver a stream 
 
•
 deliver a specific baseline 
 
•
 deliver selected activities
 

If we look closely,
•
 when deliver a stream, an internal baseline is created, and that baseline is delivered 
 
•
 when deliver a specific baseline, and that specific baseline is delivered 
 
•
 when deliver selected activities, an internal baseline is created, and that baseline is delivered
 

note for 1: if there is no change since last baseline made, then last baseline will be delivered, and no baseline will be created

note for 3: if there is no change in those activities since last baseline made, then last baseline will be delivered and no baseline will be created

When we rebase, we cannot simply just rebase to a stream. We have to select a specific baseline to take changes from. That's why the correct way of saying is rebase development stream to a baseline of an integration stream.

In summary,

When we deliver, we 
•
 deliver a baseline TO another stream 
 
•
 deliver a stream TO another stream 
 
•
 deliver activities TO another stream
 

but remember that fundamentally/internally we deliver a baseline

When we rebase, we rebase a stream TO a baseline of another stream.
